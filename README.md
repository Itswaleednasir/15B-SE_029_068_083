******Joining & Spliting of 2-3-4 Trees******

+ A 2–3–4 tree (also called a 2–4 tree) is a self-balancing data structure that is commonly used to implement dictionaries.The numbers mean a tree where every node with children (internal node) has either two, three, or four child nodes:

-> A 2-node has one data element, and it internal has two child nodes.
-> A 3-node has two data elements, and it internal has three child nodes.
-> A 4-node has three data elements, and it internal has four child nodes.

+ 2–3–4 trees are B-trees of order 4 like B-trees in general, they can search and insert in O(log n) time.

Properties:-
	-> Every node (leaf or internal) is a 2-node, 3-node or a 4-node, and holds one, two, or three data elements, respectively.
	-> All leaves are at the same depth (the bottom level).
	-> All data is kept in sorted order.


In order to run the code you have to read the instructions given below :

-> First you don't need to add any additional library or file to run the code all appropiate libraries are included in the code.
-> The Console output has three Choices like :
***********************************************
  1.Insertion	2.Traversal	3.Exit
***********************************************
   <> To insert a value in the tree u should select option 1 and press Enter then you should press any number (i.e: 1 or 2 or 10000 etc). 
   <> To Traverse the nodes of tree u should select option 2 and press Enter.
   <> To Exit From the program u should select option 3 and press Enter.
